# comprehensive-Arduino-based-robot-program

This is a creating a comprehensive Arduino-based robot program involves integrating multiple components such as sensors, actuators, and motors. Below is a detailed example code for an Arduino robot using C++. This robot can avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and move around with DC motors. The code also includes functionality to handle a servo motor for better navigation control.

          Components:
                      1. Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
                      2. Ultrasonic Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
                      3. DC Motors with motor driver (e.g., L298N)
                      4. Servo Motor (optional for scanning)
                      5. Chassis and wheels
